# AI_Project

Overview

This project implements an interactive version of the classic Dots and Boxes game, offering both single-player and two-player modes. The goal is to draw lines between dots on a grid to form boxes, and the player who forms the most boxes wins. The game incorporates an AI opponent that uses the Minimax strategy with Alpha-Beta Pruning, providing a challenging and strategic gameplay experience.
